# Project Title
### Text Emotion Classification
# Description
In this project, we developed a text emotion classification system aimed at identifying and categorizing emotions expressed in textual data. The primary objective was to build a robust model that could accurately detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust from a variety of text sources, including social media posts, reviews, and customer feedback.
# Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:

   We gathered a large dataset of labeled text samples from multiple sources, ensuring a diverse range of emotions.

2. **Preprocessing**:

   Text data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, including stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization were applied to standardize the text.

3. **Feature Extraction**:

   Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) were used to transform text into numerical features.

4. **Model Selection**:

   We experimented with various machine learning and deep learning models, including logistic regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), random forests, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

5. **Training and Evaluation**:

   Models were trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their performance.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:

   Optimization techniques were employed to fine-tune model parameters for improved accuracy.
